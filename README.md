## ðŸš€ Streamlit App

- Upload voice or type a query.
- View simulated API/scraping results.
- Get generated summary + audio playback.
- This prototype uses Streamlit as a lightweight orchestration layer to coordinate agents and simulate end-to-end flow. In a production setup, this would be handled by an asynchronous FastAPI service for scalability and modularity.
